# Case Files

Case Files is a fan expansion for the Sentinels of the Multiverse card game created by Rob Brown (bobbertoriley). This
project aims to make several additional decks playable alongside the cooperative card game developed by Greater than
Games and ported to digital platforms by Handelabra Games, alongside many other custom mods!


## What all is included?

The initial release of Case Files will include 3 decks and a few variants:

* Heroes: Charlie, Tucker
* Environments: Birchwood, Mass.
* Variants: Gun Club (Expatriette, Tango-One, Tucker, and Charade)

As more stuff get completed, it should hopefully land in here as well.


## How do I play?

All of this stuff will eventually be available to download via Steam Workshop, making things super simple. In the
meantime, you can manually download the latest released version here. To set up, follow these steps:

1. If you haven't already, enable mod support for Sentinels of the Multiverse. Right click the game in Steam and select
   'Properties'. Under Betas, select the option `mods - Alpha Mod Support`. Download any updates to the game as necessary.
1. Right click the game in Steam and go to 'Manage > Browse Local Files'. If there is not a folder named `Mods`, create
   one in this directory. Inside that folder, create another folder named `CaseFiles`.
1. Download the files from the `CaseFiles` folder in this repository and put them in the folder you created in the previous step.
1. Launch Sentinels of the Multiverse. If everything works, you should see a button `Worksop` in the main menu and
   `Case Files` as an option within that menu!
