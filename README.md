# Case Files

Case Files is a fan expansion for the Sentinels of the Multiverse card game created by Rob Brown (bobbertoriley). You can read more about it on [Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2551941)

This repo used to contain the files to download and play these decks on Handelabra's Sentinels of the Multiverse digital app. However, this mod now supports [Steam Workshop Integration](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2436980109), and this is the recommended installation method going forward.
