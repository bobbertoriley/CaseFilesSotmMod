Agent Tucker was out of her element on the Moondancer assignment. [i]The HMCS 'Moondancer'[/i] boasts the title of the largest casino on International Waters. Many shady individuals utilize this haven from sovereign law to negotiate political and business ventures under the table. One of Division 6's informants leaked intelligence of a Piece of Iniquity, a powerful demon relic, in the possession of a high-roller; this news attracted the eye of the casino's mysterious proprietor. Instead of investigating a paranormal phenomenon, or hunting a supernatural creature, Tucker needed to perform a heist: Reclaim the Piece of Iniquity before it falls into the wrong hands; rescue the informant, whom Division 6 lost contact with a few hours earlier; and abscond from [i]The 'Moondancer'[/i] without causing an international incident.

While the odds stacked against her, Tucker did not enter the assignment empty-handed. Sneaking a shape-shifter aboard as her suitcase, Charlie provided the perfect backup for a stealth mission. While she kept her derringer on hand, recent training improved control over her spirit energy. She could fire a small burst of energy from her fingertips, performing some of her handgun tricks without the need of a firearm. And despite the new surroundings, her intuition and field experience would prove invaluable navigating the den of thieves.

But time was running short; luck hardly lasts in a casino, and the duo would have to act fast or risk losing everything in the pit.
