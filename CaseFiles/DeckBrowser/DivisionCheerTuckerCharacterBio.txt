Hannah Tucker, like every Division 6 agent, knows someone (or something) lives at the North Pole. Too many wards and enchantments protect a dimensional anomaly up there; no one in Division 6 believes this happenstance or coincidence. Like any good cyptid folklore, no one has produced concrete evidence of what this anomaly means, but Tucker accepts the logical conclusion that it [b][i]must[/i][/b] be Santa Claus. While her colleagues may remain skeptic and keep a watchful eye for developments, they know better than to try and argue with Tucker on the subject.

Tucker's unshakable belief in Santa shines each holiday season; if the Big Guy can be a patron of generosity, why can't she? After Thanksgiving with her family, and a few days hunting with her dad, Tucker cashes in her vacation time to volunteer at various local charities. It's better to give than to receive, after all. Tucker likes knowing the local kids have a few more toys to open on Christmas Day and those in need get some help against the harsh winter ahead. 

Despite her attempts at spreading Christmas cheer, supervillains and the supernatural rarely rest on their laurels. Whenever a Grinch, Scrooge, or Krampus shows up to try and ruin the holidays, if the festive federal agent finds out, she is sure to thwart their plans and teach them the true meaning of Christmas.

Every Christmas Eve, Tucker puts out milk and homemade cookies. Falling asleep under a warm blanket in her armchair, she secretly hopes this will be the year she catches a glimpse of the Big Guy. She's yet to meet him, but she always wakes up to her offering gone and a small pile of presents, including one shabbily-wrapped gift 'From Santa'.
