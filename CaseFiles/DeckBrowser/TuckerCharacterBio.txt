Hannah Tucker picked up her first hunting rifle at the age of 15, and her father immediately discovered her gift. When they went hunting together, Hannah rarely missed her mark; one time, to his surprise, her shot bounced off a tree and still hit true. Between her aim, her intuition, and her wanderlust, he knew his daughterâ€™s chances of staying in Omaha were slim.

After college, Hannah joined the FBI training program at Quantico. She studied criminal profiling, pushed her body to its limits, and refined her skills with a sidearm. During training drills, her fellow students noticed the same peculiarities as her father. Sometimes her bullets delivered excessive force or carried a sparkler-like trail of light behind. Hannah could not explain the phenomenon. When news landed on the desk of Cal Azure, she wanted to see these 'trick-shots' for herself.

Cal explained the phenomenon as spirit energy, a vital force contained in all living things. While Hannah did not have control over her powers yet, her sidearm served a prime conduit to channel and release small bursts of power. The Division 6 director explained that her department handled cases of paranormal phenomena and extended the recruit an opportunity to refine her talents while serving her country. Hannah accepted.

Agent Tucker's first assignment for Division 6 relocated her to a small town in Massachusetts under the mentorship of Andrew Higgs. She would learn quickly that snipe hunts can yield results, and not all cryptids in the area would be as friendly as the tiny creature. In addition, a few of the local residents started calling the agent by her last name, 'Tucker.' This moniker has stuck with Tucker ever since.
